## Multi-Task Learning of Joint Building Extraction and Height Estimation

  This track defines the joint task of building extraction and height estimation. Both are two very fundamental and essential tasks for building reconstruction. Same as in Track 1, the input data are multi-modal optical and SAR satellite imagery. Building extraction and height estimation from single-view satellite imagery depend on semantic features extracted from the imagery. Multi-task learning provides a potentially superior solution by reusing features and forming implicit constraints between multiple tasks in comparison to conventional separate implementations. Satellite images are provided with reference data, i.e., building annotations and normalized Digital Surface Models (nDSMs). The participants are required to reconstruct building heights and extract building footprints.Figure shows an example.

## Dataset Format
### Download
[DFC23_IEEE-DataPort.zip；track1.zip；track2.zip](https://ieee-dataport.org/competitions/2023-ieee-grss-data-fusion-contest-large-scale-fine-grained-building-classification#files) 

We provide individual RGB and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) remote sensing images. For better use of multi-modal data, we provide a python script to generate 4-channel images concatenated in the channel dimension, in 4-channel (R,G,B,SAR) tif format. You can run the following command to generate the merge direcory:

```  
  python ./make_merge.py $DATASET_ROOT
```

  All the images are in size of **512x512**. The data format follows the MS COCO format, and the annotation is in json format. The topology of the dataset directory is as follows：

```

## Baseline（赛道二）
  **A baseline that shows how to use the DFC23 data to train models, make submissions, etc., can be found [here](https://github.com/AICyberTeam/DFC2023-baseline).**  
  We choose the classical **mask rcnn with multimodal multitask learning** (height prediction) framework as the contest baseline model. Among the input image modalities are RGB and SAR. We use [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) (version 2.25.1) to test the baseline model performance.  
  The [performance ](https://github.com/AICyberTeam/DFC2023-baseline/tree/main/track2) report of multimodal multitask learning (MML) framework on the validation set of track 2 (**instance segmentation and height prediction**) is as follows:
 <table>
	<head>

## Submission & Metrics
The submitted results should include **two parts**. The first part is a **building extraction result**, which is the same as the previous track with only one exception that the category is not taken into consideration in this track. The second part is a **pixel-wise height estimation result**, which is a map with the same resolution as the input. The second part should be a tif file with the same name as the corresponding optical image. 

For evaluation, the metric of the building extraction is the same as Track 1 (categories are not taken into consideration) and the metric of height estimation is threshold accuracy δ1=Nt⁄Ntotal, where Ntotal is the total number of pixels and Nt is the number of pixels that meet max(y⁄ŷ, ŷ⁄y)<1.25, where y is the reference height and ŷ is the predicted height. The final metric is the average of the two metrics, i.e., (AP50 + δ1)/2.

Current state-of-the-art methods that predict 3D from single images ignore 
the fact that the height of objects and their upright orientation is invariant 
to the camera pose and intrinsic parameters. To account for this, we propose a 
system that directly regresses 3D world coordinates for each pixel. First, 
our system predicts the camera position with respect to the ground plane and its intrinsic parameters. 
Followed by that, it predicts the 3D position for each pixel along the rays spanned by the camera. 
The predicted 3D coordinates and normals are invariant to a change in the camera position or its model, 
and we can directly impose a regression loss on these world coordinates. 
Our approach yields competitive results for depth and camera pose estimation 
(while not being explicitly trained to predict any of these) and improves 
across-dataset generalization performance over existing state-of-the-art methods.

The classic active contour model raises a great promising solution to polygon-based object extraction 
with the progress of deep learning recently. Inspired by the physical vibration theory, 
we propose a contour vibration network (CVNet) for automatic building boundary delineation. 
Different from the previous contour models, the CVNet originally roots in the force and motion principle of contour string.
Through the infinitesimal analysis and Newton's second law, 
we derive the spatial-temporal contour vibration model of object shapes, 
which is mathematically reduced to second-order differential equation. 
To concretize the dynamic model, we transform the vibration model into the space of image features, 
and reparameterize the equation coefficients as the learnable state from feature domain. 
The contour changes are finally evolved in a progressive mode through the computation of contour vibration equation. 
Both the polygon contour evolution and the model optimization are modulated to form a close-looping end-to-end network. 
Comprehensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and 
superiority of our CVNet over other baselines and state-of-the-art methods for the polygon-based building extraction.

基于框架场学习的多边形建筑分割

30 Apr 2020  ·  Nicolas Girard, Dmitriy Smirnov, Justin Solomon, Yuliya Tarabalka ·  Edit social preview
While state of the art image segmentation models typically output segmentations in raster format, 
applications in geographic information systems often require vector polygons. 
To help bridge the gap between deep network output and the format used in downstream tasks, 
we add a frame field output to a deep segmentation model for extracting buildings from remote sensing images. 
We train a deep neural network that aligns a predicted frame field to ground truth contours. 
This additional objective improves segmentation quality by leveraging multi-task learning and 
provides structural information that later facilitates polygonization; 
we also introduce a polygonization algorithm that utilizes the frame field along with the raster segmentation.
